This plugin is intended for CubedHost servers, to allow restarting from in-game.
You will need to configure it with your Prisma API key, login email, and server ID before use.

The `reboot` command is intended to be as much of a drop-in replacement for Spigot's `restart` command as possible.
It uses the same permissions, so anyone who already has these permissions can run it without further permissions assignment.

Unfortunately, this plugin cannot automatically override the `restart` command, but you can configure this manually.
Take a look at the file `commands.sample.yml` for an example `commands.yml` configuration to allow restarting with `restart`.
